Unit 1.31.1 Released
####################

We are delighted to announce Unit 1.31.1, a maintenance release that fixes
several bugs, enhances the WebAssembly technology preview, and updates tools
and packaging.


*******************************************
WebAssembly Technology Preview Enhancements
*******************************************

After a very successful launch of our WebAssembly integration in
:doc:`1.31.0 <unit-1.31.0-released>`,
we have made some minor improvements.
With the :program:`unit-wasm` SDK,
you can now explicitly set the HTTP return code of a given request.
Also, requests with payloads larger than 4 GB are now handled properly.

For more information, see the :program:`unit-wasm` SDK
`documentation <https://github.com/nginx/unit-wasm>`__.


*********************************************
Updates to the Unit CLI Tool :program:`unitc`
*********************************************

The
`unitc <https://github.com/nginx/unit/tree/master/tools>`__
command line tool is now able to convert Unit configuration
between JSON and YAML formats.
It also supports a new URI scheme :samp:`docker://`
to make it even easier to work with Unit running in a container.
