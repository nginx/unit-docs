Unit 1.33.0 Released
####################

We are pleased to announce the release of NGINX Unit 1.33.0. This release includes
a number of new features and changes:

*************************
New configuration options
*************************

This release introduces three new configuration options:

#. **listen_threads**

   This option can be set under **/settings/listen_threads** and controls the
   number of threads the router process creates to handle client
   connections. By default, Unit creates the same number of threads as there
   are CPUs available.

#. **backlog**

   This option can be set under **/listeners/backlog**. This is a per-listener
   option that sets the the backlog parameter as passed to the **listen(2)**
   system-call, which defines the maximum length for the queue of pending
   connections for the socket.

   This is analogous to the **backlog** parameter of the **listen** directive in
   NGINX.

#. **factory**

  This option can be set under '/applications/<app>/factory' and is specific to
  Python applications. This allows you to enable the `Application factories`
  feature of Python.

  This option is a boolean value. If set to 'true', Unit treats 'callable' as
  a factory.

  The default value is 'false'.

  NOTE: Unit does **not** support passing arguments to factories.

****************
unitctl CLI tool
****************

:ref:`unitctl <unitctl>` is a Rust-based CLI tool that allows you to
deploy, manage, and configure Unit in your environment.

.. note::

   This is a "Technical Preview" release of **unitctl**. We welcome feedback and
   suggestions for this early access version. It is provided to test its features
   and should not be used in production environments.

****************************
Chunked request body support
****************************

Unit can now accept chunked requests rather than returning **411
Length Required**. This feature is experimental (not documented and subject to change), and can
be enabled setting the **/settings/chunked_transform** configuration option
to **true**.

*************************************
Changes in behavior and other updates
*************************************

* On Linux, we now default to a **listen(2)** backlog of **-1**, which means we
  use the OS's default: **4096** for Linux 5.4 and later; **128** for older versions.

  The previous default for Unit was 511.

* Under systemd, Unit once again runs in **forking** mode. This allows the
  per-application logging feature to work out the box.

* The Python language module now supports **Application Factories**
  (thanks to Gourav).

**********************
Changes for developers
**********************

We have made some changes to the build system:

===============================================
Prettified make output by default with GNU make
===============================================

Instead of getting the normal compiler command for each target being built
you now get a simplified line like:

.. code-block:: console

   CC     build/src/nxt_cgroup.o


You can use the **V=1** option to get the old verbose output, for example:

.. code-block:: console

   make V=1

==============
Make variables
==============

You can now control some aspects of the build process by passing variables to
**make** (like the above). The currently supported variables are:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 80 5
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Option
     - Description
     - Default
   * - **D=1**
     - Enables debug builds (-O0)
     - 0
   * - **E=0**
     - Disables -Werror
     - 1
   * - **V=1**
     - Enables verbose output
     - 0
   * - **EXTRA_CFLAGS=**
     - Add extra compiler options
     -

===========
GCC & Clang
===========

We removed support for several lesser-known compilers. GCC and Clang are now the
only supported compilers for building Unit.

==========
-std=gnu11
==========

We now build with **-std=gnu11** (C11 with GNU extensions). While previously we
didn't explicitly set the -std= option, as we were supporting CentOS 7 (which is now
EOL), we were effectively limited to **-std=gnu89/90**.


************
Wall of fame
************

Special Thanks to all external contributors helping us
making Unit better! With 1.33.0 we would like to send a shout out to:

- Alejandro Colomar
- Costas Drongos
- Gourav
- Remi Collet
- Robbie McKinstry

Special thanks to Arjun for his fuzzing work.
