Unit 1.32.1 Released
####################

NGINX Unit 1.32.1 is a maintenance release that fixes bugs in the new WebAssembly Language Module and in our njs implementation.

===============
Resolved issues
===============

This release fixes the following issues:

**************************************************************
Applications of type `wasm-wasi-component` can't be restarted
**************************************************************

Applications deployed as `wasm-wasi-components` can't be restarted using the `restart` endpoint.

After deploying a new Wasm Component binary to disk, the restart will trigger a reload of the component in Unit without restarting the server.

As restarts will work independently of the application type, the behavior shipped with **1.32.0** was not right. It has been fixed in this release.


************************************************************
Unit-variables in NGINX JavaScript are constantly cached
************************************************************

In **1.32.0** we added the possibility to access all Unit variables form inside njs.

As reported in GitHub issue `#1169 <https://github.com/nginx/unit/issues/1169>`__ the variables were cached and would hold the wrong value, which is not how this feature should work. With version 1.32.1, we have fixed this issue.
