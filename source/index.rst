.. note::

   Going forward, NGINX Unit will no longer receive new features or
   enhancements from the project maintainers. NGINX Unit is still open to
   community contributions.

   The team is focusing its limited capacity to keep NGINX Unit stable,
   secure and high-quality. Its focus will be on critical maintenance, such
   as for security issues, dependency upgrades, and resolving crashes or
   undefined behavior.
